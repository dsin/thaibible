# Introduction #


As far as I knew, there are no Thai language Bible in PDF format that you can easily download. This makes life difficult when Thai people want to access and learn.

  * no need 3G or Internet connection when you want to read it
  * no need to crack software
  * you can print ( make a hard copy ) anytime you want

# Why in PDF format #

PDF is an open standard for document exchange([ref](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format)) and can be opened in multiple platform ( Linux, Windows, Mac, etc. ) or any portable devices ( such as mobile phone i.e. nokia, Samsung, Android Phone, iPhone, or even iPod Touch or iPad ).
